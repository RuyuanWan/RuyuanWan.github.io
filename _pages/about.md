Hello! ðŸ‘‹<br/>

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [Information Science and Technology at Pennsylvania State University](https://ist.psu.edu), working with [Dr. Ting-hao 'Kenneth' Huang](https://crowd.ist.psu.edu). Prior to starting my Ph.D., I earned Masterâ€™s degrees in [Data Science](https://cse.umn.edu/datascience) and [Linguistics](https://cla.umn.edu/linguistics), as well as a Bachelor's degree in [Statistics](https://cla.umn.edu/statistics) from the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). During that time, I was advised by [Dr. Lana Yarosh](https://lanayarosh.com/) and [Dr. Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/).  I also earned a Master degree in [Computer Science](https://cse.nd.edu) at the [Univeristy of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu) where I studied in the [ND-HCI lab](https://hci.nd.edu). 

My research lies at the intersection of <b>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</b>, <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b>, and <b>Social Computing</b>. Language, as the medium of communication, serves as the social bridge among people. Standing at the crossroads of HCI, NLP and Social Computing, I am driven to explore the intricacies and nuances of communication dynamics in the evolving digital landscape. In my research journey, I am passionate about decoding how human-human or human-AI interactions unfoldâ€”how they communicate, collaborate, and sometimes conflictâ€”and how these patterns can be harnessed to address pressing societal challenges.
