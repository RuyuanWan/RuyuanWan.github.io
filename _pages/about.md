Hello! ðŸ‘‹<br/>

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Notre Dame, working with [Dr. Karla Badillo-Urquiola](https://kbadillou.weebly.com//) at the EPOCH Lab.<br/>

My research interest is in the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and natural language processing (NLP), particularly developing human-centered language technologies for social good.<br/>
