Hello! üëã<br/>

I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science at the University of Notre Dame](https://cse.nd.edu/).<br/>

My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Social Computing.

Language as the medium of communication, communication as the social bridge among people, standing at the crossroads of HCI, NLP and Social Computing, I am driven to explore the intricacies and nuances of communication dynamics in the evolving digital landscape. For my research journey, I am passionate to decode how human-human or human-AI communicate, collaborate and sometimes conflict, and how these patterns can be harnessed to address pressing societal challenges. 

Before my Ph.D., I obtained my Bachelor in [Statistics](https://cla.umn.edu/statistics), Masters degrees in [Data Science](https://cse.umn.edu/datascience) and [Linguistics](https://cla.umn.edu/linguistics) from the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). During that time, I was advised by [Dr. Lana Yarosh](https://lanayarosh.com/) and [Dr. Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/).
