Hello! üëã<br/>

I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science at the University of Notre Dame](https://cse.nd.edu/), working with [Dr. Karla Badillo-Urquiola](https://kbadillou.weebly.com//) at the EPOCH (Empowering People Organizations Communities through HCI) Lab.<br/>

My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Social Computing, and Responsible AI. I am passionate about understanding and improving the ways humans interact with AI and language technologies, with a strong focus on promoting social good and online safety.

My current work explores the following areas: 
- **Understanding Social Dynamics and Disagreement:** Exploring demographic biases, propaganda, and other influential factors while investigating the nuances of disagreement arising from subjectivity and positionality in both HCI and NLP contexts.
- **User Engagement and Online Safety in Online Communities:** Designing strategies to promote positive user interactions and engagement in online spaces, contributing to social good, while ensuring the protection and well-being of marginalized populations, fostering inclusivity and safety.
- **Explainable, Human-centered Language Technologies:** Developing transparent and understandable AI language systems that bridge the gap between complex algorithms and human users.

Before my Ph.D., I obtained my Bachelor in [Statistics](https://cla.umn.edu/statistics), Masters degrees in [Data Science](https://cse.umn.edu/datascience) and [Linguistics](https://cla.umn.edu/linguistics) all from the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). During that time, I was advised by [Dr. Lana Yarosh](https://lanayarosh.com/) and [Dr. Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/).
