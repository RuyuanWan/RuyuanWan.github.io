Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I am a master student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, working with [Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io//) at the Minnesota NLP Lab.
My research interest is in the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and natural language processing (NLP), particularly developing human-centered language technologies for social good.

I obtained my bachelor degree in statistics from University of Minneosta - Twin Cities.
