Hello! ðŸ‘‹<br/>

I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science at the University of Notre Dame](https://cse.nd.edu/), working with [Dr. Karla Badillo-Urquiola](https://kbadillou.weebly.com//) at the EPOCH (Empowering People Organizations Communities through HCI) Lab.<br/>

My research interest is in the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and natural language processing (NLP), including: 
- **Understand Social Dynamics** in Language, e.g., social bias, propaganda, etc. 
- **Design User Engagement** in Online Communities for Social Good 
- **Develop Explainable Human-centered Language Technologies** 

Before my Ph.D., I obtained my Bachelor in [Statistics](https://cla.umn.edu/statistics), Masters degrees in [Data Science](https://cse.umn.edu/datascience) and [Linguistics](https://cla.umn.edu/linguistics) all from the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). During that time, I was advised by [Dr. Brian Reese](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/breese), [Dr. Lana Yarosh](https://lanayarosh.com/), [Dr. Maria Gini](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~gini/), and worked with [Dr. Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/).
