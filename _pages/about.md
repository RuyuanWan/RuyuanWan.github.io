Hello! ðŸ‘‹<br/>

I am a master student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, working with [Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io//) at the Minnesota NLP Lab.<br/>

My research interest is in the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and natural language processing (NLP), particularly developing human-centered language technologies for social good.<br/>

I obtained my bachelor degree in statistics from University of Minneosta - Twin Cities.
