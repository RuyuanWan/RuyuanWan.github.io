There is growing evidence showing the significant role of social determinant of health (SDOH) on a wide variety of health outcomes. In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), electronic health records (EHRs) have been widely used to conduct observational studies. However, how to make the best of SDOH information from EHRs is yet to be studied. In this paper, we systematically reviewed recently published papers and provided a methodology review of AI methods using the SDOH information in EHR data. A total of 1250 articles were retrieved from the literature between 2010 and 2020, and 74 papers were included in this review after abstract and full-text screening. We summarized these papers in terms of general characteristics (including publication years, venues, countries etc), SDOH types, disease areas, study outcomes, AI methods to extract SDOH from EHRs and AI methods using SDOH for healthcare outcomes. Finally, we conclude this paper with discussion on the current trends, challenges, and future directions on using SDOH from EHRs.
